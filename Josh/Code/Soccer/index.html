    <p id= "soccerLife">
        As a kid, I fell in love with soccer a a very young 
        age. I played for my local park district team when I
         was in kindergarten and then joined my first travel 
         team, Heat United, when I was 10. I started to really
         love the game when the 2014 World Cup started and I saw
         my favorite soccer player, Neymar Jr. Soon enough, I 
         joined Chicago Inferno for a bigger challege and stayed
         there since.
