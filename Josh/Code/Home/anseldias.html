		<p id="description"> 
		Hi, my name is Ansel Dias. I am a Senior at Huntley High School
		and live in my humble abode in Lake in the Hills. I spend time
		playing sports, hanging out with friends, working out, watching
		shows, and listening to music. My favorite soccer team is 
		FC Barcelona and I want to pursue Computer Science in the future.
